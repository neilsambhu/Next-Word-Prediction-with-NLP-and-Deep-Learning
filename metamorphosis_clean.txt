Hand rolls Check out the meat in the last pic Maybe we can get it
more upright if you help me next time
Neil Sambhu
Wow I was about to send screenshots
Thank you thank you I've had practice now Wow I spent a solid 10
min crafting that line
I made my own spicy mayo: avocado oil mayo sriracha and olive
oilThe flavor combo of the spicy mayo with Wasabi is amazing Also
I underestimated how much texture the cucumber adds to the mix
Yeah When I had pickled ginger raw as a pallette cleanser the
taste was too sharp for my liking Maybe it'll be good in sushi
Have you heard back from Annette
Lol Put her trauma management skills to the test How exciting
I've got a dinner 8 5
9 5
How's HW been this first week Anything interesting
Honors college Have fun  I know those profs can be crazy
passionate about the nuances of social science
When's it due
That last one hit hard Do you need to have a video like one of
these 4 by Sep 9
Oh no I never got into needles I haven't even done coke I meant
that I wasn't expecting needles during the party in the video The
first 3 make me happy not to be black or a woman  Assuming
they're true For my social movements class in honors when I had
to do a project I picked black lives master since I figured it
was most popular and had the most data
My idea would be to be hardcore libertarian and go for low taxes
haha I've heard the point of coke is to sober you up IDK if I'd
recommend it still lol Otherwise it's just a stimulant Like it
doesn't give you a pleasant feeling like weed
You are a good influence
I'm heading to campus a little early for my 2pm class Lmk if
you're free to hang out before then
Good luck Sounds good
I finished up TA-ing Are you in Beta I'll meet you there
Here
Wait I'm in Holly
Here
How's customer service
:
Time to take a deep breath get the 15-min talks agreements done
and celebrate in 2 weeks right
Do you want to go to the 9 11 1pm football game with me It's UF
vs USF You can sign up for tickets now at usfbullstix com The
tickets for that game get released tomorrow at 10am IDK how seat
assignments work but we can coordinate to get adjacent ones It's
free for USF students
Make the account today though The tickets get announced tomorrow
 I just realized I misread your 6:34 message It must be my old
age
I've been transgender once
Thanks for telling me in advance
No
No I just gave the box to my neighbor this morning
I chilled them in the fridge so they should be really good
Tonight's tenderloin First attempt was pretty good
Extra creamy
Here's the more traditional version
I need my Paula Deen fix lol
I was wondering if she was part of your upbringing Lol
Here's the one you'd like
Ok Jeffrey Dahmer I'm sure you would know about eating kidneys
I'm just glad to be old to someone lol
I prefer my gays more flamboyant lol
I guess I don't I'll have to check how his wrist hangs Lol
Kabeer is vegetarian You think he'll make an exception for me
Let me know how I taste My marbling has definitely reduced these
days
Thank you  I think HahaWait till you see me with a shirt off I
think people naturally look better with clothes on
For me I've found walking to be the best compromise of exercise
while still not feeling like a lot of work I'll get muscle built
maybe once I have less body fat Do you have a goal for going to
the gym
For thinness you definitely have to get a reduced body fat
Problem is that you can't easily target where you use up your
body fat
That sent too early Whoops I looked it up You're right:
Yeah I was thinking the same thing There are 3 big takeaways for
not eating: get enough salt if you have a headache keep yourself
busy and keep your mitochondria used to using fat as a fuel
source For that last point the tldr is keto it's easiest on your
body to switch between burning external and internal fats for
fuel
You've got access to 2 separate sources of veteran keto dieters I
think you'll have a smooth transition It takes 10 weeks for your
mitochondria to adapt though  Does the number gender of people
matter
Yes You'll lose weight fast for the first few days but it takes a
while for your body to get used to using your stored body fat In
my early keto days I would still eat multiple times per day Once
you get past the mitochondria there's the hormones to deal with
specifically ghrelin the hunger hormone If you make your eating
random instead of scheduled you'll throw off your body's ghrelin
signaling
You could get that done in about 3 days of not eating or 2-4
weeks of keto
Lmk if you want to prep any meals Glad you've got a full kitchen
My flame thrower should come in handy haha 9 25
No it's the culinary version called searzall I know right What a
coincidence
:D lol You'll have to let me cook for you one of these days Way
better than anything on campus
Do I get to call you master Lol Sous vide is the cooking
investment that keeps on giving
Lol I prefer real food Yeah It depends on whether you're willing
to go through the initial discomfort I'll show you how to be
efficient I feel the taste is worth it
Your tenacity is refreshing I'll be sure to help out
I'm happy to hear that I actually really like that cheese brand
Good morning Did you get your baseline weight
Time to get the junkyard scale LolIf you drank yesterday you're
probably dehydrated this morning Are you still aiming for 107 4
Wow You're crazy lol Did you go to The Study
steady Like lose 3 pounds and keep it off for good
109 4 is a very reasonable goal Since you're just starting keto
you will probably be able to achieve it by next Saturday The
initial weight loss is pretty fast Are you going to stay on keto
even after you've lost weight
What's the new gay club called I only ever went to Honeypot
If you want to keep the 3 pounds off you might end up needing to
go to 6 pounds loss and or check your weight during the normal
diet to see what the fluctuations are like
I got much more erect meat pics for you this time around
My sis said she'd have some so I doubled the recipe from 10 to 20
assuming she'd have 5 I ended up having to eat like 12 myself
Oh I forgot to mention she had 2 only
Like the keto rice
Yeah she doesn't like it There's no rice in this version though
How was your meal prep today
You should audition for Gordon Ramsay LOL
Are you still hungry
Dizzy past the morning  I didn't realize they lasted that long
You must've gotten super drunk
I think eggs help a lot
Poor baby :
I normally just drink an insane amount of water to help me I've
never had a hangover last into the afternoon I hope you're
feeling better tomorrow
goodnight
Good morning How are you feeling Also don't get discouraged if
your weight went up You probably got hydrated properly Today's
weight is probably a better baseline
Alcohol def gives a false sense of progress lol Are you still
aiming for 109 4
What a great mindset
We can cook something after my class ends 9 7 Lmk your
availability
Depends what we make Do you have a pan Cutting board If so I can
show you how to make chicken breast in a skillet Worst case I can
get a picanha All we need is a baking tray aluminum foil and the
plate utensils to eat the steak I'll cook it sous vide beforehand
Hahaha I like your worst case scenario better We can play it by
ear Do you like pork rinds Deli meat cheese and pork rinds
together is a good meal
I admire your willingness to try Good thing there's a Publix on
campus
Seaweed is a much healthier alternative but there's less crunch
Maybe keep the receipt just in case lol
Do you exist eating cheese only Lol
I'll bring some seaweed
How's 1 day after a healthy baseline Any progress
The water is definitely a good idea It'll keep your brain healthy
and alert Oh no Are sugar cravings getting to you
I def recommend pecans before meals The high fat and moderate
fiber in them helps a lot with keeping you full
I'm ready for our no-cook meal prep tomorrow You can do this
Lingxi :D
Class is wrapping up
You can tell Kabeer that there is free spaghetti tonight
I'm 1 min away from beta
Ask Kabeer to rate my sausage pic
Better
I'll get the next one He knows me too well
How is your diet meal prep going Staying keto
Wow Twins That's really good for getting you into ketosis I've
noticed hunger 4 hours after drinking coffee Oh no Is the PPT
helpful
IDK if Wang posts the PPTs in advance but I used to review the
Automata Theory PPTs before Korzhova lectured That way I could
ask better questions during the lecture Like sometimes there's a
built-in learning curve when you see material for the first time
but the profs have been teaching the same thing for years
What are your plans for Thursday I can bring microwavable grass-
fed beef hot dogs after my TA class Perfect for the convenience
of college life haha
Good luck
Has program design stress made you succumb to carbs
Good job I haven't eaten bread since December 2020
6 days in How's the weigh in
This is good progress Only 1 4 pounds to go right What tempted
you
What about strawberries blackberries and raspberries Those are
good for keto
They have low net carbs because of the fiber Great idea
If you get miracle berry you can eat the lemon raw and it'll
taste sweet
no LOL
It only lasts about 15 mins
Overhead cost is about 0 83 session of 15 mins
No other downsides
The lady there made a face when I went a second time for the
philly cheesesteak without the wrap BTW the crispiness is from
breading :P
Yeah I'll have to check it out For Publix chicken tenders it's
10g carbs per tender She must be so used to giving pasta it's in
her muscle memory LOL Stay strong though your health takes
precedence
I'm proud of your progress I hope you can hit your goal by Sunday
I think it's very possible
I support the fiscal conservatism :-
It was really good I made some really good steaks but some of the
people didn't eat the fat I was a little disappointed but I guess
lien me is The Fad these days
lean meat is The Fad these days
A little bit I got to omega-3 fats but I didn't get to go in
detail on salmon and Nori
Yeah the steak was really tender
Plus I put a pad of butter on each steak
pat
Yes it made the steaks extra tasty Only 1 didn't want any butter
They complimented the steak Problem was that I'm used to higher
caliber intelligence of people so I had to be extra polite Lol
Lol I blame alcohol for that second sentence IDK why I had to
bring up intelligence
I literally just now understood your Republican mask wearing
How's day 7 of dieting
Oh no You should still get the data so you can see your progress
from today onward What made you binge Ice cream
40g carbs is binging LOL
I think twice It's very rare
Did you want bread specifically like a craving If you bump up
your fiber your gut bacteria will change what you crave Like I
don't even have a sweet tooth anymore
LOL Well it sounds like you'll be making rapid progress soon if
these are your worst times
Nov 13 should be about when keto becomes natural because you're
mitochondria are fully fat adapted That would be a convenient
time to try fasting
Do you want to make food Tuesday after my class Hotdogs
Ok Microwave should be quick
I'm meeting up with a friend for lunch Lmk if you're free before
your 3:30 class I dropped my Monday Wednesday class  If not see
you tomorrow
I found out that my tuition waiver doesn't cover UG classes Good
luck Don't let the stress make you break your diet
Hotdogs come in packs of 4 Can you eat more than 2
Yeah My schedule is free I'll get a ticket for my email
I just got mine This one is at 7pm so it def won't be as hot
We'll finalize details Friday Saturday I can pick you up IDK if
you planned to go with Kabeer Anna Ana  etc as well
Are you trying to pregame :P
Reminds you of being part of the collective in homeland China Lol
How was RA stuff
Oh lord
Can you ask Anna next time you see her if she left a hair tie in
my car I'm assuming it's hers It's black and fluffy
Class finishing
I'm 1 minute away
Are you interested in this Friday night  I didn't see any keto
foods unfortunately
Have fun
1 5 weeks in How's the weight going RA stress manageable
Have you tried Wim Hoff breathing You'll get your rest and digest
parasympathetic nervous system response
Yeah I was thinking the same thing lol Good job  Now on to fat-
adapted mitochondria for the win Lips still looking
Resolution must be low enough that I can't tell LOL
How else am I supposed to objectify you
Everyone I had an extra greasy forehead
Saturday I'm going to help my friend setup some computer
equipment at USF and then we're going to lunch IDK what your
plans are in the afternoon but lmk when you're free I'll be on
campus Later we'll head to Raymond James
How's the weigh in at the 2-week mark Also I'd wear a vinyl water
resistant jacket tonight I'm going to wear my hiking boots
What did you eat to cheat Stress eating from RA classes
I'll meet you at Lot 5D just north of Beta at 5pm
We can talk during the drive ETA 4:53pm now
Here
North where we met Maya
How's today's weight Can you get butter sriracha and soy sauce
for Tuesday
I'm salting the meat now It should be good
Yeah it's dry brining Typical brining is normally done in water
with salt and other spices though
Yeah You don't get to put other flavors into the meat but it's
very simple
Lol we're lucky she spelled everything else right
I remembered one other ingredient for Tues: black pepper
If it's not too much trouble
Yes and water them with your tears from doing program design
homework LOL
Just wait till you get to OS I was struggling and I went to every
class
Yes Clearly I've passed the mark of humility where I assume
superiority Good thing I've got my PhD advisor to keep me in
check
superiority without trying to put someone else down
I flipped the steaks Check out how red they are
I'm heading to beta hall
I'm downstairs outside
I just finished watching that YouTube video I think the other
side of that coin is the individualism of people having a right
not to get vaccines even before COVID-19 or wear a mask So I'm
glad you get to experience America
It kind of hit last night when I thought about how there's no
chance of my mom's mom being a great grandma Let's see how
October is though Overall I'm doing OK
Thanks Lingxi 3
I think so My dreams are weird but I think it's a sign of healthy
coping I really appreciate you checking up on me It means a lot
For the past 2 nights I've had these Frankenstein's monster-esque
dreams about my grandma going through regular life reanimated
I'm going to interpret it as needing to put emphasis on my own
health
How is your weight going with your period
Your mitochondria will thank you lol BTW I feel like your skin
has gotten clearer I'm assuming it's because of less carbs
Chicken wings Only if they were coated in a sugar sauce e g BBQ
teriyaki honey
breaded
Good choice I've noticed I can eat a lot of chicken Like if you
tried to eat the same pounds of beef it'd be a lot harder Chicken
is much leaner
I'm excited for our bacon Tuesday Do you want to see what I made
today for dinner
keto bread
I even mixed jalapenos in with the batter so they were a little
spicy
Yes
Yes it added a little spice I didn't take a picture but I also
added some salsa verde and Crystals hot sauce to the eggs
benedict for a little more flavor It worked really well with the
hollandaise sauce
Oh no
Oh dang It's 1M Scoville
Homemade I got a packet per my friend's recommendation but then
we decided to make our own since the packet had 20g carbs
wow
They hide the carbs in such a small serving size
Exactly By the way you might want to add some ranch or buffalo
sauce with the wings to give them some extra fat and flavor
Yeah I'm ready lol I heard from a friend that eating steak will
cause vivid dreams Let's see if the beef from dinner will do the
trick haha
Pretty good I visited my other dad's mom today and helped her
with Skype and WhatsApp It's a nice reprieve
Lol get rid of the other
Thanks again for checking
Thank you Lingxi I'm sure it's no surprise but I'm planning to go
to Longhorn Steakhouse for dinner tonight
I hope they cook it evenly I went to a restaurant Sunday and they
gave me one side as medium and the other side as rare  That's the
medium rare steak lol
What to wear to the IEEE banquet lol
LOL
He def has one as long as he's not stressed How'd it go with
email profs about lab space I know you said Canavan's lab is full
Did anyone else have availability
Oh wow I guess they're really raising the standard Maybe see if
you can do a formal independent study with one of the profs in
spring 2022
hahaha Oh yeah I forgot you had an exam today How did it go
I hope you get partial credit If I remember correctly she's
pretty good about that Hendrix for algorithms is similar
Nice Hopefully the TAs are fast at grading
 is the modulus operator It's division with the output of the
function being the remainder of the division Example 5 2  2 52 1
In C code 0 is false All other values are true So you can rewrite
that statement as
if ab  0
What did you think
oh no
Maybe you'll get the rest of the code structure right
: You'll get it next time
Let me know how your HW is Tuesday I can get Captain Morgan if
you want to drink
Sounds good So we'll have bacon and keto brownies I also got some
chocolate and pecan butter no artificial sugar I think we'll have
enough food Should I bring hot dogs too
3 weeks in How's weight loss going
My apologies How has your binging frequency been
I enjoy your mindset it sounds a lot like a true lifestyle change
Ok Have I shown you my spreadsheet
I hope you can see how much I enjoy body weight and body fat data
lol
Please forgive my projections from myself onto you
The wings were actually better than I could make They had a
really good seasoning blend The steak was evenly cooked as I
requested but it wasn't very tender Plus there wasn't so much fat
I'm hoping my parents take me to Bern's one day It's tough
because my mom and sis are vegetarian except chicken I want to
see if I can beat Bern's  Or see how close mine is
Your willpower is in the mitochondria By middle of Nov when your
mitochondria are fully fat adapted you will notice an improvement
in your will power
I'm actually meeting up with a friend for lunch today at Texas
Roadhouse so let's see how Texas Roadhouse compares to LongHorn
Steakhouse
Yeah Do you have a good memory of the quality I'm pretty sure
it's been over 5 years since I've gone
I think I'm really going to like Burns next time I go I love
fatty The only time I've had too much fat was when I cooked
brisket and there was literally at least half an inch thick of
fat
Did you go upstairs to the desert room
Do you remember what cut of steak you got
I will make a rib-eye in these upcoming weeks Let me know how the
quality compares
Yes and yes
Am I a naive individual
Excellent Thanks for the data
Thank you
I love the irony of this situation because I'm meeting up with my
Muslim friend Ahmed and I'm the fully bearded one in this
situation LOL
I think it's required for some Muslim I am speaking on behalf of
what my Egyptian neighbor told me
Lol
The 72 virgins need a place to frolic
I think it's what the Quran says Don't worry I'll make my
barbecue church where you get 72 been around the block hoes
Realize there are literally millions of people who follow this
religion
No need to wrap your head Just become transgender and wrap your
legs
Take pipelining to a whole new level
Oh shoot I guess you might not have learned about pipelining yet
Just imagine the five stages of operating on assembly code like
you learned briefly in computer organization
You stagger the stages so that stage one of the second line
starts right when the second stage of the first line has begun
It's actually even cheaper You just have to blow yourself up
Priceless
I'll tell my friend to review these specific chat messages to
help him better discriminate against Chinese woman Jk
I forgot about that
You might need to reinforce the walls in those containment units
I heard the Muslims can have very explosive personalities
Don't worry We're in the Deep South I'll make sure to keep my
racism well hidden
Speaking of racism I low-key really want to marry my driving
process with you to see if you're able to pick up on it Like I
don't just drive like a normal person I always drive like I'm
driving on track oh so I know exactly why I'm making the food I
want to make
God dang autocorrect
want to explain my driving
making the moves
Speaking of racism I low-key really want to explain my driving
process with you to see if you're able to pick up on it Like I
don't just drive like a normal person I always drive like I'm
driving on track so I know exactly why I'm making the moves I
want to make
Crazy how 2 words can make such a difference lol
I sure do love imposing my will on others keto driving technique
computer science   I'm at Texas Roadhouse Ttyl
I was a little concerned that substituting olive oil for water
milk in the recipe would turn out bad but the quality control
piece I tried was good I'm excited for tomorrow
You have a baking sheet for the bacon right
Happy birthday Lingxi  Can't wait for us to cook after class
Class will probably let out early today
Nvm I thought nobody would show up 1 did :P
Class ended How's your homework Do you want to drink
Which class By the way I'm 3 minutes away
I am OMG What did they say
Yeah I mean you kept the same name and race haha
obese
LOL I get what you mean now
I didn't realize you were adding on to what I was saying I
thought you were adding to the surprise because you have a
specific type
I actually took Single off my FB right before you messaged me
What are you going to do about your parents
Yes FarmVille was all the rage in 2011 LOL Ok I still stand by
telling them because of the nearly guaranteed benefit in
hindsight
Let me know how your schedule looks Friday evening I can make
some steaks and help you study for the Saturday exam
Yeah I definitely want the data on how good my ribeyes are
compared to Bern's Maybe you can learn how to make a really good
steak :P
How was day
Omg  your day
Lol pretty good I got us a picanha for Friday Publix didn't have
any good ribeyes
I read through a research paper Waymo to get some info for my
Monday meeting I'm trying to figure out the similarities between
the accuracy metrics between Lyft and Waymo so I can figure out
how to attack the dataset I also ran some errands and got some
pumpkin seeds for my dad from Costco
They're Google's self-driving company
Yeah Waymo started as a Google project and then spun off as a
separate company
I keep thinking about you wrapping your arms around the back of
my neck in bed
What happens if you get A's next week
I have a treat for you when we get finished studying tomorrow
Thank you I'm really looking forward to seeing you today
I just parked at MSC I'm heading to Beta
I'm 1 minute away
Someone let me in I'm waiting downstairs
I'm glad you told her Let me know what she says next time you
talk to her I'm sure she will have a different opinion once she's
had some time to think about it
Lol Does she think Indian is too different
I miss kissing you
How did you do on the discrete structures exam
Oh no Do you think today is your Peak period
Thanks I took a nap and now I'm headed to my friends house in
Apollo Beach to make some ribeyes
How is your stomach feeling Any better now
I'm pretty sure you have a twin bed Do you have a measuring tape
I'm wondering if you'd be able to fit in an air mattress that is
full or queen size
I'm talking about the area where your carpet is
Like if your carpet area can fit a full queen then I can get an
air mattress that fits Also worst case I'm sure I can find some
really supportive pillows so we can spoon together on your bed
without your shoulder hurting
Probably you could move the chair if needed
I'll check Walmart tomorrow
Are those USF's pillows or your own If the former I'm wondering
if you can get 2 more
Lol OK I got the mattress and pump
I just got the Pic Lol
Yeah I was thinking that we won't be able to double up the
pillows on the queen bed
Omg Haha
Ok I'm at temple
Service over Time for high-carb vegetarian dinner lol
I think Studio Movie Grill is now thisLOOK Dine-In Cinemas
Tampa813 618-5883
I kind of wanted to swim Saturday when the pool opens Lmk if that
works with you
This is the epitomy of what Indian food looks like lol
FIT on the north side of campus
Do you want to plan Friday dinner and Saturday lunch I assume
skip breakfast I figure we'll be done by Saturday evening
Do you want to go out for the movie Like not Netflix and chill
lol  I'll leave the meal planning to you this Friday Saturday Is
that too much responsibility
Ok I'll check the schedule We can make steaks from Publix for one
of the meals I can show you how to do it without sous vide
Check this out Tuesday I think that's when it'll be updated
Actually making burgers is even easier Let's try that
I miss you I can't wait to spend the night with you again Good
luck with your 2 exams this week I'm sure you'll do great
I think my heart just dropped a little I'm literally so happy I
showed you the mattress pump I got 2 pillows with covers and 2
queen blankets I figure Friday 5:15pm I'll back into lot 5D we
take out all the stuff from my trunk I'll park and then we'll
take the stuff up to your dorm I put a tape measure in my trunk
but I think it'd be really great if you could make sure you've
got a 60 x 80 area in your dorm
Check out 1:46 IDK if this is the same app but here's the one by
Apple:
Thank you
:D This is going to be the best weekend I've had in a while
We just need it to be close Like we kind of want to get an idea
of what the dimensions of the space are so we know how to put the
air mattress Plus if we have to set it up and take it down every
time I show up then we'll need to coordinate where to put the
bedding It's more work anyway
Ok lmk how it goes I woke up this morning thinking about how
amazing I'm going to feel waking up next to you
How was the leftover picanha
I'm glad you enjoyed it Did you drink water Yeah we'll work on it
I prefer to front-load the work on Friday evening and then catch
a later movie
If I were you I'd go crazy with drinking water Like try to get 32
oz in and wait an hour to re-evaluate
Oh no Did you see which sections you lost the most points
hopefully you can get the paper back during office hours
I got 2 ribeyes for Friday If you can get ground beef and cheese
for Saturday that'd be great
Yeah you've got your exam Tuesday right I know that's definitely
the priority
How's your headache
I'm happy to hear that We must be syncing up LOL Oddly enough I
was just thinking about how you were so considerate of my sleep
last time I spent the night
You're good :P I just hope I can teach you how to cook LOL It's
honestly one of my passions
I know you can open a bag of pork rinds and slice cheese haha :P
I'm ready for you to spend 8 hours peeling Chinese corn for me
LOL
Remember how you said you're like your mom who would spend the
whole day cooking something Maybe you can show me how well you
can make burgers Saturday Do you have a non-metal spatula
Excellent I'd love to have that experience So do you have a non-
metal spatula we can use Saturday I haven't pickled them myself -
only watched my neighbor do it
Great Looks delicious reminds me of baklava I haven't I think my
preference to keto food is obvious LOL For me I'm eating this
evening instead of fasting and I feel a little guilty LOL
What more could I ask for in a girl :D I like those last 3 more
haha I have a big meal Tuesday planned so I want to fast to help
reduce my weight gain I've been steady at around 168 pounds I
really want to try to break below my all-time low of 165 9
I enjoy your acceptance but I've got to get this weight loss to
have min 120 age LOL
10 body fat Doing the calculation now it's 140 pounds It used to
be 147 pounds I think there is not perfect calibration of the
body fat percent calculator
Also longer penis to reach your g-spot :D
Thank you
IDK how to explain how I feel better too I'm not used to get such
consistent boners when you touch me haha
Assuming we get to spend 10 15 together I'm pretty sure that's
when I'm going to start getting the feeling of wanting kids LOL
Oct 15
Once we overcome difficulties together I'm sure that thinking
through the years will be more easy
I am I'm planning 2 weeks out for predicting how I'll feel
I've got data LOL I'd like to think you're getting on my
wavelength
:P
Good luck on computer organization tomorrow I know you'll do well
on your exam Let's clutch this program design this weekend too
Do you have T-Mobile
Nvm about T-Mobile Do you have a spare towel I'm seeing if I
should bring mine for swimming showering Saturday
I'm good I'm about to make lamb tonight :D How was the exam
Yeah I don't like the game-y flavor I think this will be tasty Oh
no Let's see what it is when she grades it
Miss you too
I'm so full haha
Sous vide and then broiled Yeah I used to do a lot more grilling
Now I do more pan broil searing
Good morning I keep thinking about how I made you wet Saturday
Did I do something specific
I feel like I've got so many reasons to be excited for Friday I'm
happy you know what that specific thing is I can't wait to hug
you
I mean I really want you to push your butt against me too lol
Hey that sounds good to me Did you leave time to go over your
work at the end of the exam
:
Nervous with overconfidence sounds unfortunate Maybe try
meditation before the exam to clear your mind
Exams are a time to focus on yourself only Maybe I'm preaching to
the choir here
I can help you study for the next exam We'll get this project
finished up this weekend Can you send me the instructions
nsambhuusf edu
I want you to succeed
I just saw your email subject LOL Honestly I can't wait to know
what I said did to make you wet I know it doesn't have to do with
money and that makes me happy
I really want to sit next to you and put my arm around you
I looked over Project 4 I think we should be able to do it within
1 hour Do you have any other work
Did you measure the floor at your dorm to see how the queen
mattress will fit
Also are there outlets nearby for the air pump I don't remember
Do you think we'll be able to leave it inflated or take it down
when we're done
I wanted to make sure you'd still be able to move around your
dorm with it in place I'm happy to hear that though How was your
day
Must be the Indian spawn point LOL
Yeah Sounds exotic haha What does she have do that you want Mine
was pretty good I finished up the lamb with my dad and got
started on this PPT for next week I present to my research group
Sounds like she's really good at presenting an attractive outward
appearance People think you're a lesbian because you don't
accessorize Well at least now you've got a boyfriend to make
people think otherwise haha
No I'm just presenting on another paper I've read
I did Lyft Now I'm presenting on Waymo Google Unfortunately Tesla
doesn't release their data
LOL I can definitely understand idolizing others I remember this
one guy Mariusz Pudzianowski whom I used to idolize back when I
was in elementary school from his wins at the World's Strongest
Man competition
I googled it LOL I actually thought his first name was Mario
I looked him up on Wikipedia It doesn't look like there's
anything recent about him
Also for some reason I thought he was from Spain
He's Polish
Definitely former USSR type
No Always older
Actually there's this one guy in my high school who had beautiful
parents and now he's turned into a very attractive muscular guy
His only downside is being so blonde that his eyebrows and
eyelashes are barely noticeable
Time for a makeup session LOL I'm actually going to visit him 10
16 We're meeting up to celebrate another friend's recent marriage
No Bradley
LOL I don't think I know any Alexanders He's in Orlando now
I can see that
LOL I also knew a blonde named Hope in elementary school I'm
guessing there's a religious basis Competition is a great
motivator haha
I can't stop thinking about you
Is it cheesy if it's true
I didn't even realize I was being cliche
I'm just being myself What do I do to make you happy Tell your
how I want you to succeed
Lol I'll be baby and mother  jk Are you saying you like my
personality
How I intertwine our futures by planning If I can get to the
first principles than I can pay more attention to myself I'm
still so ready to know how I made you wet Waiting until tomorrow
is going to feel so long
What's that supposed to mean  Lol I've got the world in my grasp
AKA internal locus of control
I hope so except for this skiing accident On the flip side I'm
only adaptable for what I've prepared for or seen before
Yeah Am I good at being your boyfriend
That's such a high compliment I'm glad someone can recognize me
I just finished napping off a migraine We definitely need to be
careful if I ever see your phone when it's dark My guess is that
my computer was bright last night it's hard to say
This one was actually better because I could still drive home
I've had worse TBH I don't want to go to the movies for a
different reason  Lingxi I think I'm about to fall for you and
I'm so excited to let it happen
Yes I'm really happy I had Autopilot to take most of the work off
me Plus this migraine finished after 3 hours so at least I've got
the evening I've been holding off on blowing my load since 9 26 2
Sundays ago which is the longest I've gone in a while I really
really want to be inside you ASAP once we get done with Project 4
I already got hard just typing this
Saturday evening right before I leave
My Way is really easy and convenient because we can basically do
whatever we want There's no issues with condoms slipping off and
I get to have max sensitivity still I do want to try out the
female condom just for fun I have 1 from the FIT
I want you to be relaxed enough for your first time I also really
want you to be wet so everything can happen naturally
Trust me on this There are issues when people wait beyond 5 days
to take it and when someone weighs over 150 pounds You'll be OK
You should get your period early like 3 days of taking the pill
This works hormonally so the egg literally won't get released or
won't attach to your uterus I've been through this before It's
super easy The only downside is lack of STD prevention
We can just use condoms then BTW condoms are just for pre-cum
Like I shouldn't actually cum in them when I'm in you Do you want
to try My Way once to see how it affects you
I'm similarly anxious I don't want you to feel pressured I'll
clarify that this other girl had her period after about 3 days of
taking My Way We can see how it is for you if you're willing
Otherwise we've got condoms
I know you've got your stat exam tomorrow I want you to be able
to focus on that without additional anxieties We'll have a good
time tomorrow I don't want your first time to be stressful
How are you feeling now
Maybe try unclenching your jaw if it's unconsciously clenched I
can't wait to see you tomorrow Best of luck on your exam
At Bible study with neighbors Stress eating
Yeah we're making steaks now so that's why I joined lol It's my
first Bible study I figured I'd give it a try Maybe try pecan
butter and chocolate next time If you want something crunchy
there's pork rinds I'm assuming you'll see this in the morning I
believe in you You were very confident and methodical when we
worked on stats HW I know you'll do well Just take a deep breath
and focus on yourself You can do this Also I hope you can fast
until dinner this ribeye is going to be amazing
How was the stats exam
:D
I miss you too This week has been so long without you I'm about
to leave I'll meat you at Lot 5D north of Beta ETA 5:20
ETA 5:15 p m I just left
I'm here
I'm 1 minute away from beta
I really like when you call me your boyfriend when we're together
but I don't feel anything when I'm introduced as your boyfriend I
think that's a good thing
Even though I boast about my her as a Ph D I'm not actually
interested in the superficiality of being a trophy husband
my path as a PhD
Keep introducing me as your boyfriend I'm saying the feeling is
much more about how you and I perceive each other instead of how
others perceive me
Can you send me a picture of your thermostat
Also if you're able to take the cover off please send the picture
of the wall mount
Uh oh Probably you don't need it Thanks It was good I made lots
of food
Yes Homemade
I was nervous as well This is normal You don't have to be
Christian to have faith lol Remember that you took it within 24
hours and if you count me cumming in you which I'm getting hard
just remembering that time it's more like 8 hours
Maybe 12 hours
Can you pull the thermostat up and off There should be wires
underneath
YES
This is amazing Do you happen to see a yellow wire We need the
red and yellow wires
I love thinking about the first time I came inside you with so
much cum I really enjoyed when you talked about it inside you and
feeling it drip out
I enjoyed our time together too Also you pushing back against me
right before I left was so hot I wonder if we can get the angles
right with us clothed I'm behind you and you happen to push back
I'm literally so hard right now lol I'd love that Can you see if
Publix has salmon filet If not we can do 1 sausage 2 baked
avocado egg and cheese or 3 beef tacos in lettuce wraps The one
thing with the salmon is since you don't have a freezer you don't
want to leave it in the fridge for more than 2 days
We'll broil it with salt pepper and garlic skin side up I'll put
butter on the flesh side to keep it from sticking to the aluminum
foil The skin will get really crispy I hope you like it
Do you like fishing
Yeah I haven't gone in a while though  Maybe 2017
Lakes around my neighborhood and the Skyway Pier
Yes Bass and pin fish in the freshwater ponds Pin fish and trout
in saltwater
Is that your version of leaves
I don't know I only really have one datapoint to start haha What
did you mean by clouds
Oh LOL The pic hasn't sent yet
Now I see it I guess it doesn't show on my computer as fast as my
phone
Incredible I have something more indoors-y
Yes I like it
almond flour I'm going to try pecan flour next Almond flour is 13
carbs Pecan is 0g net carbs
Yeah My dad said it'll be good for eggs but the texture isn't the
same as regular bread He couldn't specify the property though
I'll get this bread down by November I think
Yes and  Validation of daddy not dying at 62
No I just wanted to see if the vid chat would work I wonder what
would happen How was food at The Hub
Thursday's salmon is going to be top-notch :
Thursday before your class take the salmon out of the fridge so
it can come up to room temperature before we cook it
Do you have scissors I'll bring some
Did you get your period today Maybe it'll be later in the day
Yeah It must vary between people I know I've read somewhere about
an early period being possible I know last time before we had sex
your period was 5 days late right The anxiety is a normal feeling
I think the 84 includes less-than-optimal use with 1 day
ingestion after sex
I like your mindset How would you be more responsible Condoms
Earlier dose
Birth control is more effective than condoms
I thought unprotected sex was like 50
Lol you're right Maybe Pintrest isn't the best source of medical
advice lol I like birth control and Plan B because you can't
really mess it up
Definitely lmk what data you get about your period compared to
normal
I'm saying you can't mess up like the condom breaking or falling
out
I'm pretty sure the 16 is using the dose on women over 150 pounds
and or after 1 day
There's a reason behind each data point Let's take the condoms
statistic If one uses condoms properly then they'll be 100
effective However some of the time the condom breaks lack of Lube
or falls off not staying hard these happen sometimes with an
overall 15 resulting in pregnancy I'm saying there has to be
causality for the failure cases unlike the true randomness of
flipping a coin
Thanks for being so good with analyzing feelings Good luck with
class today
1 person showed up
Lol I miss your hugs and holding my neck
How's keto going Any Oreo binges
Oooh My girlfriend being a good girl I like the zing of that
submissiveness
No Different guy
I guess I should be grateful that all I have to do is sit here
Plus I happened to get a charging spot so that's a benefit
No it's not weird You told me how you like Old Spice so I wear
that before I come over lol
BTW I think of saying your name when I'm turned on so I think
that's a good sign
Do you happen to remember how I smelled Saturday after showering
That was just deodorant I'll finish the Old Spice and then move
on to the other sprays colognes family had gifted me
Do you remember if just the deodorant was good BTW my neighbor
Sam wants to invite you over for dinner one day lol He was the
one who specializes in A C and told me about the wire colors
I hope it's pheromones Do you know you can aim the pheromones He
is He's sort of starting keto
I'll try to aim between your legs lmk when I'm particularly
smelly haha
IDK if there's a noticeable smell I just think you can get the
ghost-like feeling of touch from them Even better I don't have a
fake PhD like my aunt the community builder lol
Neither is hers lol A PhD in community It's not even a PhD She
just paid someone who will speak on her behalf if anyone asks
Good thing for her is that most docs she markets to are medical
so they don't even know about PhDs
Hers is only to buy herself credibility Like I don't think there
are any real PhD programs that have community as the major
There's no pushing of the state of the art with what she does
She's smart like a fox  more like the cunning or sly connotation
I don't know specifically but I think the added credibility
boosts her ego and makes her more appealing in the news and to
investors
Her business is JPaC named after her kids She's a narcissist She
thrives off the continual validation from others
Fortunately she hasn't hurt me directly I just don't have
Christmases with my cousins since my aunt and uncle divorced in
2012 I'll give an example of something weird: my cousin bought
watches for me and the rest of them because it was my grandma's
favorite brand and she wanted us to have them I know my grandma
was barely able to talk in her later days I sort of get the
intentions behind memorabilia but it's just so weird
I think so Like they're sort of fancy I don't think they're 200
It's more of the setup that I think is strange Like my aunt did
the same thing with her kids grandma on the dad's side having her
buy them gold chains This is another reason I really liked how
your mom raised you This is the type of materialism that's all
for show
I was wondering why I have 2 heart emojis How do you know its a
heart still
Can you send a screenshot
How interesting Well I guess that means I'll have to send you the
heart that looks a little more curvy on my end It must be
symbolism for how I see your butt as rounder lol
I'm glad you see me in such a positive light I really wonder what
about me is funny and Charming I know I try to make jokes
I just resend my last message I think the Network timed out
That's a really good explanation Thanks
I really hope one of us gets leaves by 2024 or some equivalent
I really like to understand myself in reference to others
Getting some symbolic meaning from inanimate objects
Remember how I said I almost feel like some leaves are gifts from
one of my past friends from high school For example the leaf with
a fork on it as good luck
That's when we both graduate so that's what career decisions have
to be made and you might end up leaving Florida
Yes In the case of the formk with the leaf on it I interpreted
that as good luck Otherwise so I normally just feel reassured
that my friend is with me oh almost like the religious symbol of
a cross
Yes I'd like to say we've got the lasting friendship that is very
rare
Maybe a better way to put it would be me being in love with the
Nostalgia of past It'll take us a few years to develop that sort
of longing for the past
What do you mean She's already engaged
Also she's the one who told me about monogamy
I'll tell you what to think I know how to collect data from my
past and am looking forward to using these milestones as a basis
of knowing how close we become together Without my past I
wouldn't have as strong of guidance or as much confidence in what
to look for I'd much rather be in this position than be blind
Settled I can see where you're coming from but remember that I'm
not living in a fantasy world pursuing a lesbian who's engaged I
view us as having a lot of potential This is what excites me I
mean I keep planning my future with you I hope that shows my
emotional interest in you
I appreciate the honesty I think this is all very healthy
Are you feeling anxious that I'm not going to be committed to you
That perspective opens my eyes a lot In terms of the comparison
I'd like to see this more as metrics from my past that I think we
can use to see how close we become Also I was more recently in
love with the hoe I think of as symbolically yellow I fell out of
love with her I would have seen her as more compulsively pressing
in my mind I really think that having landmarks for what to look
for will end up helping us
To be clear you're my first girlfriend When I talk about
landmarks I'm talking about the feelings that occur when people
get close Back in high school I didn't have the social competence
to have a mature relationship like I do now I'm hoping that we
can hit those landmarks seeing them as how people grow close I
can tell you that a great one is how I view the blocks of life as
how I will include you in them This is in granularity of days and
weeks I enjoy you being a part of how I plan my future
Regarding comparing me to a past love I think seeing where each
of us is relative to the population is useful so I know which
traits stand out and which traits help the relationship
Can you give me an example of what we wouldn't be able to do Also
I tell Dan I love him I would like to think I have really great
friends I'm not romantically involved with anyone else besides
you I should have been more careful when I responded yes when you
said that it sounds like I'm still in love with her I should
clarify that becoming close friends lends itself to a lasting
form of love without the romance
Also if you remember the advice your various friends give you
this will help you retroactively find out who has the best social
advice I'm realizing now how troubling this situation is since I
said love I hope you can take away that my threshold for
explaining is more on the side of revealing too much and causing
anxiety as opposed to hiding something from you and trying to be
closed off
Ok Thanks for reaching out Take your time I did have one point to
mention I felt a little uncomfortable hearing that a random guy
would give you his IG and Snapchat I trust you to know that I
shouldn't be worried I hope my actions similarly speak for my
willingness to use my past to guide my future with you A future
where we have mutual respect and trust for each other
If in love means romantic love I shouldn't have used the term
love at all I still cherish the good times I've had in high
school Her path and mine have already diverged I have to be
realistic with myself She's a lesbian You're not the second
choice If I wanted to hang out with this other girl I would have
put all my free time into spending time trying to chase her I'm
not about that Once I started to get to know you I wanted to keep
spending more time with you I am putting you first I'd rather
tell you something more revealing than less revealing Remember
that I tell Dan and my neighbor that I love him I realize that
this was the tipping point in hurting you I want to make sure
that you know I'm very transparent with you In this case love has
the connotation of romance I want to view this in a positive
light of my past time in high school being generally good I'm
trying to say that I think uncomfortable feelings about our
interactions with others will happen In this case the coefficient
is greater for you I'm saying that I think we'll be able to grow
together because of our mutual trust
I'm saying I consider my neighbor to be my first love since we
shared such memorable times cooking and playing Nintendo Wii
together In fact I clearly remember some moment when we were
playing Nintendo Wii that I will remember forever This isn't a
romantic thing but I like to consider these people regardless of
gender because they were very influential in my life and sources
of great happiness I remember talking about the leaves but I
don't remember the part about me doing anything to be close to
her What I meant by the leaves is that it's like having somebody
watching over me as a sense of assurance I feel like this is the
least materialistic and most wholesome reward a crazy person
could feel I'm saying that we can both face discomfort regarding
each other's interactions with other people Clearly you are more
hurt then I was However these are natural feelings and we will
start to build trust toward each other as time passes I think the
key part here is definition of love For me it is very easy for me
to love my neighbor I'm still very focused on monogamy with you
but I don't think this should take away from the fact that I
still have great memories and not romantic love for people from
my past From my perspective I think this is one segment of an
anxious avoidant cycle Instead of running away or playing hard-
to-get like some sort of devious tactic I want to be as
transparent as possible I think my honesty now will end up
causing significant trust in hindsight
I'm really optimistic about our future together Lingxi
I really appreciate your rephrasing It's almost like you know how
to negotiate well  I think that last sentence really nails down
the issue I like to think of myself as one with strong
perseverance I try to spend a lot of time with you without
negatively impacting either of our study times If I still wanted
her so badly I'd be scheming to try to break up her engagement At
minimum I'd try to spend as much time as possible with her
Instead I'm putting time toward you trying to use my past as
guidance for what we should look for Tldr: I put more effort into
spending time with you than with this girl from my past
I really like your logic It's kind of hot LOL No that's a
different friend same high school Also it's more like an informal
get together after my friend got married
Thanks Yeah I don't have a problem I'm sure you now know how to
handle your liquor better than last time haha You and I should
definitely go out one of these days I haven't been clubbing since
last year LOL
I don't want to impose but do you girls want me to join Friday
night
I do but it's not until lunch time We can coordinate the
logistics when I see you Thursday BTW no need to sugar coat it if
Maya wants to go with you only I'm really glad we've had these
discussions today I'm going to bed now Goodnight Lingxi I miss
your hugs
I might be extrapolating from too few data points but I sense a
pattern in my dreams from 9 29 morning and this morning Since I
was crazy over you last week I'm thinking next week will be
really good Let's see what happens
Yes That's because those are one liners I don't remember exactly
but I think we might've had multiple lines It's definitely safer
to use them My dream started with a similar anxiety of cheating I
didn't I just really want monogamy to the point of obsession  I
was driving an RV with Jeff Bezos Somehow I was able to fly a
little by accident landed back down and couldn't stop I pressed
an emergency stop button I almost stopped safely but ended up
crashing the side of the RV through a pillar in a repair shop
There are definitely some destructive similarities How is the air
mattress holding up Has it deflated yet
We can put it back up Thursday together How is your workload
looking through the rest of the week Lmk if you want help
Thursday after salmon
Depending on your studies we can do something e g Movie Saturday
evening and maybe Sunday morning e g Swimming and food I'm sure
we can finalize our negotiations tomorrow :P Have you heard back
from Maya
Ok I'll try to keep our cuddle session Thursday brief to give you
more time 3 I'm really looking forward to tomorrow
I'll bring some avocados tomorrow I miss you
I'm so happy I think of saying your name when I want to cum lol
Hopefully I won't be too turned on tomorrow
Good morning I honestly felt so cared for when you covered my
eyes with your hand I think that amount of light was ok but it's
the thought that counts
For you maybe it's 5 days instead of 3 between taking Plan B and
getting your period Is the bleeding less than usual
Lmk if it lasts shorter Like I'm thinking you didn't have as much
time to build up the uterine lining I'm really excited for today
Not yet
I loved when you talked about my cum inside you I feel so
masculine lol
I've got the heater ready for the A C Get ready for some baby-
making juices
Time for cuddles
I keep thinking about how I got wet from you pushing into me It's
so hot I'm getting a little hard right now lol
We have the technology to destroy the juices Haha
Good thing I'm pro-abortion I would make such a good Catholic lol
I see what you mean I like the over-the-top satire though Like
barely any Republicans are so supportive of abortion
I don't actually want you to have one either I think our combined
planning skills will keep us safe BTW it's kind of hot that you
went to the doc to get birth control - not because of sex but
because of your foresight planning
Ok
Is there anything else that turns you on more than me telling you
what to do Or anything similar
Lol I'd say that hip movement thing shows otherwise
Did you ever get a chance to see me inside you For me the visual
of sliding into you from behind was so hot Lingxi
I should have said visual in my mind Like imagine the sexy
version of a traumatic memory
Also I have the grass alternative: oregano
Class finished early
okay take your time
I'm 2 minutes away
Reminder when you get back: dinner at Dan's after class Thursday
I finished up at my neighbor's I'll shower and head to USF Lmk if
you want me to stall till 8pm
ETA 7:15 p m
I just parked I'll be downstairs in 3 minutes
I missed you on the drive home I think we're set for some good
times
It was good It looks like we're going to be setting up an annuity
to give monthly payments to my oldest Aunt She's struggling the
most out of my mom's sisters
I realized my car didn't send a message when I responded No she
doesn't have kids fortunately That looks delicious
Maybe we can get egg wraps and make a keto version of dim sum
Lol
Yeah I know there's an ice rink in Wesley Chapel near my house
I'm not very good LOL I don't fall though I just go slow :P
XTRA Ice
We can plan it out Thursday after dinner Is going to the movies a
higher priority than ice skating
Oh no I definitely prefer sitting down than physical activity LOL
Very true haha
Dinner is canceled with Dan Thursday Do you want to make hot dogs
Thursday after my class Lmk if you need time to prep for
Saturday's exam Maybe I can help you study
Miss you too
Dinner with Dan is rescheduled to next week 10 28 Does that work
for you Did you start birth control today
Did you start birth control
Ok I think the convenience of being intimate will be really great
I had a busy day today I hope one day I'll be able to come home
to you
Nothing super terrible specifically My grandpa isn't doing do
good I think his time is coming
Yeah he's a difficult guy in the hospital Like he's not easy to
talk to and he's kind of rude I think it was triggered by grief
of my grandma passing Yeah my dad is making steak I'll probably
make shrimp with my neighbor I'm glad you know what cheers me up
haha
Probably we'll saute it in the pan I love you Lingxi 3
I'm sure I will Thursday
Did you see if you've got anything in GEMS  Payroll that shows
your employment They automatically take out taxes for me so
that's how I know I'm getting money from wages to put into a Roth
IRA IDK how it'd show up for you
Goodnight I'm really happy to hear from you
LOL I really think I'm falling in love Like I felt it a lot when
I texted you around 5pm I think it depends on my testosterone
Let's see how tomorrow morning is haha
What's the best music The one you showed me on the drive from
Orlando to USF I forgot the name
What's the significance of October
WOW Haha
Falling in love with Lingxi to make a Ling-he to give to some
lesbians LOL
I love getting cozy with you
Our son LOL
Ling-X
That's the gender-neutral name LOL
I think I'm starting to feel more emotional with you caring about
me Maybe one day I'll be able to cry from how much love I feel :D
My car's in the shop getting paint protection film installed so
my dad is going to drop me off from USF Do you want to meet him
He's got a Corvette LOL
I'm feeling ok with regards to yesterday's events I found out
some tax information about IRAs that I'm kind of disappointed
about It's ok though Ok have fun with class Flip a coin and see
what happens I think the Corvette is a great talking point LOL
Maybe he'll let you go for a ride
Yes LOL
3
My dad is going to visit my grandpa after USF Are you fine with
me staying with you for any 1 5 hours and then my dad picks me up
for about 1 5
That's fine
Do you still want to say hi to my dad
I'll lyk when my class ends and we can meet outside LIB
I'll meet you at the second floor of library after my class You
can meet my dad when he picks me up
I'll meet you at your dorm
Yay
I can't wait to see you
I figure we'll have until about 3:30pm together
I'm 4 minutes away from beta
I definitely had some pre-cum when I went to the bathroom Good
job
Lol
I love you
No I just enjoy our time together
IDK how your HW will be Saturday but maybe we can go to the pool
Sunday
Yeah I hope you feel comforted Also remember I don't naturally
smell like Old Spice haha Hopefully it's pheromones instead
How long are you gone for China in the summer Are you waiting on
updated covid protocols for next year
That'll definitely be tough I'm glad you plan in advance though
No it won't be I'm happy to hear that Hopefully we can get enough
pics of us to show to your parents I tried to get Google Photos
to get all the pics of your face but I think it needs time for
the machine learning to process all my pics
How were classes today
Glad to hear about your progress I had the most intense set of
dreams from this morning Maybe it's because of the 3 sausages I
ate I know my friend told me that eating steak will make his
dreams more intense Yeah 1 month mark was yesterday I feel
fortunate in that I did my grieving when she was alive now it's
on to my grandpa Thanks for being there for me
I'm not sure if I should go into the details of the events but I
kept going in and out of self-awareness in the dreams Like I knew
that I was feeling something intense and questioned if I was
drugged That context really helps me believe it or not
No and yes Maybe it was the sausage that drugged me LOL I forgot
to mention an important part I only ended up sleeping for about
six or seven hours but I felt very alive It was almost like
concentrated sleep
I made oven fried beef fat
Thanks I'm not sure I guess I got enough sleep But I did go back
to bed LOL It was just a strange experience Maybe if you overeat
on some sausage you'll get the same experience
Grass fed That's what I'm bringing tomorrow Also I asked my
doctor about nitrites and nitrates in deli meats and sausages He
said they aren't that big of a concern for heart attack risk I
saw a YouTube video that showed how we naturally produce a lot
more nitrites and nitrates than exist in reasonable quantities of
food
LOL I meant that innuendo as well Yay
I miss cuddling with you
I think I've practiced saying your name a lot these past 2 days
haha
Is the birth control effective by 10 25
Ok
I can't wait to see my comfy couch you today
By the way I found out that your sex-drive will probably go down
while on birth control
LOL
I just parked I will be at beta in 5 minutes
I'm in the lobby Time to get our steps in lol
In case we have issues with the air mattress this might be the
reason why
I'll plan to visit you at 3pm Saturday Lmk if we should change
the time based on your computer org work I think
I understand Sounds like a plan
Love you too
Thank you Did I tell you specifically that you should lose weight
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that I brought up the similarity
between me jerking off and you talking about feeling pretty when
you're hungry I wanted to make sure that this wouldn't cause
issues for us in the future because I could see the reinforcement
loop
Also remember we talked about this shortly before I left
yesterday I addressed how I don't want to hurt your feelings and
clarified my intentions I see what you mean I strongly stand by
that aim because I've got 1 datum to show that's the best value
for a woman I have a better way to present this idea: assuming
you're going to undertake a body fat reduction endeavor your aim
SHOULD be 12
Another rephrase would be that while my current goal is 10 a goal
of 12 for woman is more like 4 for me I'm trying to explain the
differences between us especially since I stage this 10 goal
often
state
I realize I ended up giving you the exact opposite feeling of
what I originally intended I'm saying you should not have the
same aim of 10 like me
I greatly appreciate your choice to embrace the keto diet with me
This alone makes me feel very supported The body fat reduction is
all under the context of you feeling pretty from our conversation
yesterday I'm trying to make sure that you have an appropriate
lower bound before feeling pretty becomes unhealthy
I shouldn't say lower bound I'm motivated by the 12 in terms of
being healthy If I see other MRIs I'll know better
In terms of the expectation I can see how you feel this way I was
under the impression that your feelings of weight loss were
persistent like a given This might be my key inaccuracy I know
feelings can be transient
Thanks for explaining the pushy part From my perspective I feel
like I'm continually giving data That way when I'm wrong someone
corrects me
I want to understand your feelings Does your mom influence you
wanting to lose weight and now you see losing weight as a way to
feel pretty Like I'm trying to understand the structure of the
idea losing weight to feel pretty I actually thought about saying
I love you too as a response Omg The benefit here is we don't
have meaningless conversations I actually pay attention but I'm
sure I misunderstand contexts
I hope this helps you but I'm thinking this is probably a typical
issue whether actual or perceived I hope we can talk more as we
get closer Personally I can only see from a true anorexic's
perspective how the issue was worse than mine However I totally
understand how a person's feelings e g self perception can
deviate strongly from evaluation relative to the population
3
Not mean I'm not hurt
You're all good Thanks
I'm feeling pretty good I periodically missed your hugs today
though
Good luck on program design tomorrow
No nothing bad Yeah it was good My lab mates presented I didn't
have to do anything
How was everything with you
You can have a separate property with the dogs both of which are
tax exempt I just need to find out if capital gains for the 501c3
are taxable
Looks like gains after 1k are taxed
Oh lord No thank you I'd rather have the avocado tree towering
over us
Hey I'm trying to find out what you like to make you cum It's
just that your clit is so sensitive I want you to feel good from
the g-spot too but I don't think it's as easy to cum from g-spot
I have an idea for the cuddles:
You need a dog to cum
They even have a picture of you in that first image:
I didn't realize size mattered to you so much JK JK I just wanted
to say that
How about this
Or this
He's created from my people: the millennials or whatever comes
after that
I hope 8in is big enough for you big girl:
I feel so modern as a gen z This one comes in variable sizes:
Which show
Oh Star Wars I'm not calling you fat I'm talking about 8 inches
and making a sexual innuendo
Me neither I just thought you'd like baby Yoda Did you see the
next one Almost 40 for the big one
Whoops LOL
Is 7 feet big enough for you I think my grandma has one of these
I've seen clips here and there at my neighbor's house
You can get one of these for when I'm on a work trip that way you
can still have something similar to cuddle with:
LOL
How about 20 of these LOL
This is the weirdest one I've seen:
LOL  Clearly these 3 people don't see Osuner to be as fabulous as
he she is:
Second one is a gallbladder
How about one of these
Or maybe this is more your style:
What about the pregnancy pillow We can both live out my fantasy
of being a caveman LOL
For when it's a full moon:
Imagine you're all cozy in the pregnancy pillow and then wham
vibrator time LOL
A caveman who likes to minimize taxes LOL
hahahahaahha
I actually know a Democrat who probably has similar views on the
anti-gov't stance
He's an anarchist I'm more Libertarian
BTW I really loved when you were telling me to cum That was like
maximizing my caveman feelings
LOL I always thought lasting longer was a good thing If we hooked
up when I was 17 we wouldn't have this problem When a guy is
really sensitive and or hasn't cum in a while premature
ejaculation is more of an issue Also low stress helps cumming
faster Yeah I'm libertarian I put my emphasis on economically
conservative e g Flat tax more than being socially democratic
Since my far left labmate also called himself libertarian I'm
thinking it's a fad term for people born in the late 90s
Thanks commie
omg Cummies for the commie :D
Yummy nummy cummies for the commie
hahahahahah
OMG
BTW given the tax benefits and possibility of common law marriage
outside of FL probably you'll be my fiance forever
Common law marriage is when people live together for long enough
and then are considered married IDK how any state enforces that
If we stay in FL then common law isn't a probably Regardless
we'll lose out on tax benefits once we reach 539900 year each in
taxable income So maybe the taxes won't be much of a problem
I think my leaves would say otherwise However I hope you've got
better insight into me than I do myself
I'll become the next Annette with having my 501c3 where I cook up
keto foods for everyone and have them donate money I'm actually
serious about that
I'm talking about the keto part but with my take on love for
cooking I'm basing my subsequent thoughts on you being monogamous
with me forever: I figure a lot of our life decisions will start
to manifest when we get our first jobs out of school I'm kind of
self-centered in that I know I need to take care of myself and my
family first when we're in our 30s IDK how much free time we'll
have However I'd like to think that 1 saving money and 2 having a
long life expectancy will mean that helping others will happen
eventually e g after kids are 16 years old
Ok Goodnight
How was your exam
Yeah Did the free response get you again
Let's hope for the best Of course I do want to bring up a slight
anxiety I have from our discussions yesterday Personally I think
that balancing work and child-rearing is a significant endeavor
I'm a little concerned with the amount of charitable work we'd
end up doing I think we see charitable work in two different
lights where I see charity is a way to lower taxes and have fun
Overall though I'm glad we're having these discussions now
Lol OK
